# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  lack of proper error handling during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails silently if a database query encounters an issue. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The original code attempts to fetch user data based on ID.  However, it lacks error handling for the database operation.  If the database query throws an error, the application crashes without providing any useful information to the user or logs.

## Solution

The solution includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors from the database operation.  If an error occurs, a more informative error message (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error) is sent to the client, and the error is logged for debugging purposes.  This prevents application crashes and provides better feedback to users and developers.
